Technical things that would be nice to implement:

- app-model is not a model and must be splitted
- app-view is too big and has non-view responsibilities
- details-view is too big and hard to understand
- scrolling init is complicated and requires css tricks every time
- group shouldnâ€™t inherit menu
- remove jQuery itself replace jQuery-style dom patches with reactive rendering
- increase test coverage
