Technical things that would be nice to implement:

- app-model is not a model and must be splitted
- app-view is too big and has non-view responsibilities
- details-view is too big and complicated to understand
- scrolling init is complicated and requires css tricks every time
- group shouldnâ€™t inherit menu
- remove jQuery itself and jQuery-style dom patches, use reactive rendering instead
