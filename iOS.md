### KeeWeb

We don't have an own app, but there's a workaround. However it's recommended to use a native app instead because they provide better user experience and integration with built-in security features of iOS, such as AutoFill, Face ID, secure storage, and so on.

## Blacklist

We advise against using these iOS apps:

- MiniKeePass: abandoned, has issues
- PassDrop 2: abandoned
- KeePass: they have simply stolen the name, it's something else

Also there's a number of other abandoned apps in the App Store not mentioned there. We strongly recommend not using them, since they're not kept up to date with latest security features of iOS and the KeePass format.
